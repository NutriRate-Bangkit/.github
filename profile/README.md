## About
Public health in Indonesia is heavily impacted by a lack of awareness regarding nutritional information on food products, with only 6.7% of consumers reading labels (Amerta Nutrition, 2023). This ignorance contributes to rising rates of obesity and other non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as diabetes. To address this, NutriRate is a mobile platform that helps consumers make healthier food choices by providing clear and accessible nutritional ratings based on the food they input. By offering an easy-to-understand grading system, NutriRate empowers users to make informed decisions and aims to improve public health outcomes across Indonesia.
